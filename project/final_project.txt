Our game that we implemented was mini golf! For this project we used the following items with each functionality:

LCD- coloring the screen and drawing the boundaries for our level. Along with this we used this to constantly draw the ball and update its position.
Audio- We kept the audio on our SD card and played a claping sound whenever a user sucessfully scored a goal.
Accelerometer- we use this in order to find the orientation of our board. Then, we draw a line in said direction so the user can see which direction their ball is going to go.
User Button- This is how the user tells the game when it wants to shoot. Once they chose a direction, they can shoot the ball by pressing the user button.
Nunchuk- This is used to select a level. The program takes the user to a level selector and then they use the nunchuk to pick the one they want to play.
SD Card- We store our images and sound in the SD card, so we call on it whenever we have to retrieve them.

These are all the core functionalities along with how they are implemented in hardware.
