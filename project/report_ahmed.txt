Audio
I was responsible to make the audio to work. I was having trouble with the audio to work.
I download an audio from http://www.wavsource.com/stuff.htm
and thats how I was able to overcome this technical challenge 
This is how we met the sound requirement 
I would start with this task first 

Visual (main screen and victory screen) that was a team effort 
I was responsible for desinging the vicotroy screen and making the image screen 
Just formatting difficulites and those were quickly overcome 
This is how we met the visual requirmeent 
No change from the start of the project 

Nunhcuk and sd card 
I was responsible  for nunchuk input which i solved by using the correct inits 
The sd card had to be swapped with my partners due to read only techincal difficulites 
This is how we met the sd card usage and nunchuk requirement  
NO change from the start of the project meaning I would do this in the order it was done 
 
headings 
I was responsbile for getting the headings so Griffin could draw lines so that the user would know where to aim the ball 
Not really techincal issues with this 
This is how we got the core functionlaity of the game working 
No change from the start of the project see above as the meaning 


testing 
This was how we ensured we meet the project requirments 
I tested for bugs and Griffin fixed those bugs 
We worked together to isolate problems with the levels and came up with solutions 
NO change from the start of the project
