There were a couple tasks that I was in charge of for the final project. They were as follows:

LCD / boundaries / game physics- this was how we colored and played our game. I was in charge of drawing the board and moving the ball once a direction was piced. This involved using the LCD's to redraw the boundaires and ball constantly and to not allow the ball to move past a given point. This was difficult because we had to costantly be checking where the ball is and making sure it doesnt go past a certain spot. This woul be easy if we had a function like f3d_lcd_readPixel() inorder to see if a pixel was black, but since we didn't I had to manually check where the ball was going using if statements. If I went back to this again I would definitely use a buffer to store the pixel values of the board so I could have a simpler solution than a wall of if statements.

Accelerometer - I was also in charge of setting up the accelerometer to find the angle the ball will stavel given board tilt. This was not terribly difficult since we used the code from previous labs. Then, since I already knew how to implement LCD function, I could draw the desired angle easily. This was difficult because we had to get the angle when needed and to draw. Then, we had to delete the drawn angle if it was no longer at a certain tilt. If I could redo anyhting I would have a better solution to not have the angle go into boundaries (again something a buffer could have fixed).

User Button - I had to implement the user button in order for the user to chose the desired angle from the accerlerometer. This was a simple feature and it was implemented well. I did not have technical difficulties excet that sometimes it caused the level updating to be laggy. I don't believe I would change anything about this implmentation if I could.
